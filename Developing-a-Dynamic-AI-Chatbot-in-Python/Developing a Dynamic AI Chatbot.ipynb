    "A key feature of an interactive chatbot is its ability to maintain a **conversation history**. This allows the chatbot to consider the context of previous exchanges and provide more coherent and relevant responses. Managing conversation history involves tracking both the prompts sent by the user and the responses generated by the AI. Doing so enables the chatbot to reference earlier parts of the conversation, which is particularly important for maintaining the flow of dialogue and ensuring that the responses make sense in context."

      "\n",
      "The Bali Nyonga people are an ethnic group living in the Northwest Region of Cameroon, with a significant population in the Bali locality. Their history dates back to the pre-colonial era, when they were a dominant force in the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to oral tradition, the Bali Nyonga people migrated to their current location from the nearby town of Bamenda, which was their ancestral homeland. They were said to have been led by a prominent chief named Nyonga Nchare, who founded the Bali village in the 17th century.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the pre-colonial period, the Bali Nyonga people were a powerful and influential group, known for their skilled farming and trade practices. They were also skilled craftsmen, producing beautiful wood carvings, masks, and other traditional crafts.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the arrival of European colonial powers in the late 19th century, the Bali Nyonga people, like many other Cameroonian ethnic groups, faced significant disruption and upheaval. The Germans, who colonized Cameroon from 1884 to 1916, imposed their own systems of government, education, and economy, which often clashed with traditional Bali Nyonga practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the aftermath of World War I, Cameroon was divided between France and Britain, with the French controlling the majority of the country. The Bali Nyonga people, like many other Cameroonian groups, suffered under French colonial rule, which imposed forced labor, taxation, and cultural assimilation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the mid-20th century, the Bali Nyonga people played a significant role in the Cameroonian independence movement, with many young men joining the fight for independence from France. After Cameroon gained independence in 1960, the Bali Nyonga people continued to play a prominent role in national politics and society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, the Bali Nyonga people are a thriving and vibrant community, with a strong sense of cultural identity and tradition. They continue to practice their unique customs and traditions, and many have achieved success in fields such as agriculture, commerce, and politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope this brief history provides a good overview of the Bali Nyonga people in Cameroon. Do you have any specific questions or would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect of their history?\n",

      "5. Agriculture: The Grassfield tribes are primarily farmers, with a focus on subsistence farming and local markets. They grow crops such as maize, cassava, and yams.\n",

      "The United Kingdom of Great Britain, commonly referred to as the UK, is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of government. Here's a breakdown of the key elements:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Monarchy: The UK has a monarch, currently Queen Elizabeth II, who serves as the head of state. The monarch's role is largely ceremonial, with most executive powers being held by the Prime Minister and other elected officials.\n",
      "2. Parliament: The UK Parliament is the supreme legislative body, comprising the House of Commons (elected representatives) and the House of Lords (appointed members). The House of Commons has 650 elected members, known as Members of Parliament (MPs), who are responsible for passing laws and holding the government accountable.\n",
      "3. Executive: The Prime Minister, currently Boris Johnson, is the head of government and is responsible for making key decisions and leading the country. The Prime Minister is usually the leader of the political party with the most seats in the House of Commons.\n",
      "4. Cabinet: The Prime Minister is assisted by a team of ministers, known as the Cabinet, who are responsible for specific portfolios (e.g., finance, defense, education). The Cabinet is responsible for making decisions and implementing policies.\n",
      "5. Local Government: The UK has a decentralized system of government, with three devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. These administrations have varying degrees of autonomy and are responsible for matters such as healthcare, education, and local governance.\n",
      "6. Judiciary: The UK has a separate judiciary system, headed by the Supreme Court, which is responsible for interpreting laws and ensuring they align with the country's constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key characteristics of the UK's system:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Parliamentary sovereignty: The UK Parliament has the ultimate authority to make and amend laws.\n",
      "* Separation of powers: The executive, legislative, and judicial branches have distinct roles, with checks and balances to prevent any one branch from dominating the others.\n",
      "* Constitutional monarchy: The monarch's role is symbolic, with most powers held by the Prime Minister and elected officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "This system has evolved over centuries, with the UK's constitutional framework shaped by historical events, such as the Magna Carta (1215), the Glorious Revolution (1688), and the Human Rights Act (1998).\n",

Born on June 23, 1972, in Marseille, France, Zidane began his professional career at AS Cannes before joining Girondins de Bordeaux in 1992. His exceptional skill, vision, and technique on the field earned him a move to Juventus FC in 1996, where he won the UEFA Champions League in 1996 and the Intercontinental Cup in 1996.\\n\\nZidane's most notable achievement, however, came when he joined Real Madrid in 2001, leading the team to a UEFA Champions League title in 2002 and winning the FIFA World Player of the Year award three times. He also captained the French national team to the 1998 FIFA World Cup title, scoring twice in the final against Brazil.\\n\\nAfter retiring from playing in 2006, Zidane transitioned into coaching, taking over as Real Madrid's head coach in 2016 and leading the team to three consecutive UEFA Champions League titles from 2016 to 2018. His impressive managerial record and ability to inspire his teams have cemented his legacy as one of the most successful and iconic figures in football history.\"}]\n"
